Created a full-stack app with user authentication via passport and JWTs.
So, It uses MongoDB for our database, Express and Node for our backend, and React for our frontend, also intigrated Redux for state management for React components.
App will allow users to
1. Register
2. Log in
3. Access protected pages only accessible to logged in users
4. Stay logged in when they close the app or refresh the page
5. Log out
